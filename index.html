				<p>
					NEWS-e Forecast Viewer is a desktop web application that
					allows for the easy selection of image products to view by
					selecting important parts of image file names from menus.
					There are images corresponding to day (Date), time
					(Forecast, Minute, Hour, Period), Percentile, and product
					(Environment, Rad/Sat/QPF, Severe, Rotation, Verification,
					Members). A choice from any of the menus will update the
					<code>src</code> value of the
					<code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element holding the image product
					in the middle of the view. Menus rely on metadata provided
					in a <code>json</code> file that should be named for the
					build and placed in <code>public/data</code> relative to
					<code>src/</code>. The Warn-On Forecast group uses NEWS-e
					Forecast Viewer to conduct user research studies on
					forecasters.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the Dates menu to be accurate, when the app is in active
					use, <code>public/data/getdates.sh</code> must be run (on
					the server where the build is live) every day until the user
					tests are complete.
				</p>
				<h2 id="for-developers">For Developers</h2>
				<p>
					NEWS-e Forecast Viewer has been built out several times for
					different user groups. Each build has its own branch in git.
					Typing
				</p>
				<p><code>git branch</code></p>
				<p>
					in console while in the directory will reveal branches for
					builds. <code>master</code> refers to &quot;realtime&quot;.
					Differences in builds include changing the survey link and
					other minor layout differences, but generally revolve around
					the name of the <code>json</code> file referenced in the
					main app container to <code>fetch</code>. the
					<code>json</code> data structure is very specific. The
					Warn-On Forecast team knows this data structure and is
					responsible for providing the file to the app for each
					build.

				<p>
					This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. Check
					out the most recent documentation for CRA
					<a
						href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md"
						>here</a
					>. To truly feel comfortable with the codebase, you will
					need to be familiar with CRA, and
					<a href="https://reactjs.org/">React.js</a> in particular.
					The
					<a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html"
						>documentation</a
					>
					for React is very robust and relatively easy to read and
					understand if you understand Javascript and web development
					principles. Starting there if you are new to React will be a
					big help. Otherwise, reading through this document (where
					you are now) will help you understand the code as I have
					written it.
				</p>
				<p>
					To the left the components that make this app work are
					organized and documented based on the way the src folder is
					organized with respect to .js files. Every class, function,
					and state object has been commented.
				</p>
				<h4 id="useful-tools">Useful Tools</h4>
				<p>
					If the app has issues, a helpful tool to debugging is the
					React Developer Tools browser extension for
					<a
						href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en"
						>Chrome</a
					>
					and
					<a
						href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/"
						>Firefox</a
					>.
				</p>
				<p>
					React syntax is very well supported in
					<a href="https://atom.io/">Atom text editor</a>, a free text
					editor with many useful packages for developers. It is
					available in the Self Service app store.
				</p>
				<h3 id="reproducing-the-app">Reproducing the App</h3>
				<p>
					From the terminal, navigate to the directory where the src
					folder is. For example:
				</p>
				<p><code>cd rwof</code></p>
				<p>
					Make any changes that may need to be made in src, and again
					from terminal:
				</p>
				<p><code>npm run build</code></p>
				<p>
					This command will produce a production build of the app in
					vanilla webstack code. The contents of the
					<em>build</em> folder that appears level with
					<em>src</em> can be moved to a live web server.
				</p>
				<h4 id="important-little-things">Important Little Things</h4>
				<p>
					A production build will not work properly if the
					<em>package.json</em> file lacks an attribute for the
					homepage. This information gets translated to complete
					relative links written in &quot;syntactic sugar&quot; or
					short hand code.
				</p>
				<p>
					So before running the <strong>build</strong> command, be
					sure to add the relative live address for where this app
					will live on the web server to <em>package.json</em> on the
					outermost attribute level on the tree. For example:
				</p>
				<p>
					<code
						>&quot;homepage&quot;:
						&quot;/projects/wof/news-e/realtime&quot;</code
					>
				</p>
				<p>
					is appropriate for a build that has its
					<em>index.html</em> placed at
					<code
						>https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/projects/wof/news-e/realtime</code
					>.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this example, <code>build</code> was renamed to
					<code>realtime</code>.
